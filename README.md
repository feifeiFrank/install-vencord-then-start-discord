## Search-friendly summary

This repository is for people who want a launcher that installs Vencord, re-patches Discord after Discord updates, and then starts Discord automatically.

It is especially useful if you were searching for terms like:

- install Vencord then start Discord
- Vencord auto install before Discord launch
- Discord update removed Vencord
- Vencord launcher for macOS
- Vencord launcher for Windows

## What this repo is not

- It is not a zero-permission installer
- It cannot bypass macOS security prompts for another user
- It does not bundle Discord itself

## Platforms

- macOS: supported by `run.command`
- Windows: supported by [`windows/run.cmd`](./windows/run.cmd)

## Requirements

### macOS

- macOS
- Discord installed at `/Applications/Discord.app`
- `git`
- `go`
- Internet access for the first launch and for future Vencord updates
- Homebrew installs in `/opt/homebrew` or `/usr/local` are detected when the macOS share app is opened from Finder

### Windows

- Windows
- Official Discord desktop app installed
- PowerShell
- Internet access to download the official `VencordInstallerCli.exe`

## First run

### macOS

1. Clone this repo anywhere outside OneDrive or iCloud syncing folders.
2. Double-click [`run.command`](./run.command).
3. The first run may take a few minutes while it clones and builds the official Vencord Installer CLI release.
4. If macOS says the app cannot be opened because Apple cannot verify it:
5. Open `System Settings` -> `Privacy & Security`
6. Scroll to the Security section
7. Click `Open Anyway` for the blocked app
8. Run the app again and confirm the second prompt if macOS asks again
9. If macOS asks for administrator permission while patching Discord, approve it.
10. If macOS still blocks writes to Discord, grant the terminal app or generated app the required permission and run again.

### Windows

1. Clone this repo anywhere outside OneDrive or cloud-sync folders.
2. Double-click [`windows/run.vbs`](./windows/run.vbs) for the app-like launcher, or [`windows/run.cmd`](./windows/run.cmd) if you want to see logs in a terminal.
3. The launcher downloads the official `VencordInstallerCli.exe` on first run.
4. If Windows asks for permission, allow it and retry if needed.

### Windows single-file share

- Use [`windows/VencordLauncher.cmd`](./windows/VencordLauncher.cmd) if you want one file you can send to other people.
- The single-file launcher still downloads the official `VencordInstallerCli.exe` on first run.
- It stores the downloaded CLI under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DiscordWithVencordPortable\cache`.

## What the launchers do

### macOS

1. Finds the installed official Discord desktop app
2. Clones or updates the official Vencord Installer source code
3. Checks out the official Vencord Installer release tag `v1.4.0`
4. Builds the official Vencord Installer CLI locally
5. Runs the Installer CLI in `repair` mode against Discord
6. Lets the official Installer CLI download/update Vencord's release `dist` files under `~/Library/Application Support/Vencord/dist`
7. Requests administrator permission if macOS blocks the normal patch attempt
8. Verifies Discord was patched with the official Vencord data path before launching Discord

The generated macOS share app follows the official Vencord Installer layout. It does not bundle a fixed `Vencord/dist` folder and it does not use a private dev-install path. This avoids the old problem where a stale bundled build or personal absolute path could stop working after Discord or Vencord changed.

The launcher intentionally builds from the latest official Vencord Installer release tag instead of the upstream `main` branch. This avoids breakage when upstream development code is temporarily not buildable. Advanced users can override the tag with `VENCORD_INSTALLER_TAG`.

After the first successful run, source code is cached under:

```text
~/Library/Caches/DiscordWithVencordPortable
```

If an update check fails later because the Mac is offline, the launcher tries to keep using the cached source.

### Windows

1. Finds the installed official Discord desktop app
2. Downloads the latest official `VencordInstallerCli.exe` if needed
3. Runs the Vencord installer CLI against Discord
4. Launches Discord

## Build a share bundle

Run:

```bash
./scripts/build-share-app.sh
```

Output goes to `./output/`.

The generated release zip is:

```text
./output/Discord.with.Vencord.Portable.app.zip
```

## Push to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Then create a GitHub repo and connect it:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

- If patching fails, check `/tmp/vencord-portable-install.log`
- If the macOS share app fails on first run, check that `git` and `go` are installed and available in `PATH`
- If macOS asks for administrator permission during patching, approve it so the launcher can modify `/Applications/Discord.app`
- If you want to force a clean macOS rebuild, delete `~/Library/Caches/DiscordWithVencordPortable` and run the app again
- If Discord updates and Vencord disappears, run `run.command` or the generated macOS share app again
- If macOS shows "Apple could not verify ... is free of malware", go to `System Settings` -> `Privacy & Security` and click `Open Anyway`
- If macOS blocks writes to `/Applications/Discord.app`, grant the terminal app the relevant permission and retry
- The generated share app is not a zero-setup installer; recipients may still need to approve permissions on their own Mac
- On Windows, use the official desktop Discord app and rerun `windows/run.cmd` after Discord updates
- On Windows, installer logs are written to `%TEMP%\vencord-portable-install.log`
- On Windows, [`windows/run.vbs`](./windows/run.vbs) runs the launcher without leaving a terminal window open
- On Windows, [`windows/VencordLauncher.cmd`](./windows/VencordLauncher.cmd) is the portable single-file option

## Windows note

Windows already has official Vencord installers, including a CLI:

- [Official Vencord download page](https://vencord.dev/download/)

This repo is useful if you specifically want a "install Vencord, then start Discord" launcher workflow.

## Important note for people you share this with

Even if the app bundle is portable, the recipient still needs macOS permission to modify `/Applications/Discord.app`.
